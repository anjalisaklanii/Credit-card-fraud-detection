# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Description

The model is trained on a dataset of credit card transactions and uses features like transaction amount, timestamp, and location to identify patterns that may indicate fraud. Python and scikit-learn are used to implement a Random Forest classifier model.

Key outcomes:

- Data exploration and visualization to understand transaction patterns
- Feature engineering to derive new attributes that improve model performance 
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Random Forest model
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score metrics
- Model achieves 95% precision in detecting fraud in test data


## Installation

The code was developed in Python 3.7. The key libraries used include:

- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
